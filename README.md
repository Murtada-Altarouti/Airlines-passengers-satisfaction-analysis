The objectives of this project is to analyze the dataset and get to know what factors lead to customer satisfaction for an Airline by answering the following:

1. What is the total number of satisfied and unsatisfied passengers?
2. What is the satisfaction rate with respect to Gender, Type of Travel, Class, and customer type?
3. Is there high relationship between any two columns?

At the end of this project, we will try to build a machine learning model to predict the passenger satisfaction using Logistic Regression from Scikit-learn
